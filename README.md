Hello, welcome to my Tic Tac Toe Telegram Bot.

Unfortunately, I am not able to upload it to the server, but I would like to show how does it work.

At the beginning, the user see a short description of the bot. To activate it the user should press "Start".

Then the board appears. By pressing the cell, the user choose there would they leave their mark (heart).

In lose/win/tie situations, the bot displays different pictures and messages.

If the user presses the occupied cell, the game will crash.
